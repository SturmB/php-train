# A Virtual Train

An exercise in plain PHP.

## FAQ

### What is this?

This is simply an exercise to help brush up on my PHP object-oriented programming skills. The primary task was to make sure the PHP classes are implemented correctly and are written in plain PHP (no frameworks nor libraries).

### Can I use this?

Sure, but there's really not much point to it as it's just an exercise. Perhaps it can be used to study how to program with plain PHP and even to implement AJAX calling without a database backend.

### How do I run this?

You'll first need to have some sort of AMP stack running. You could use [LAMP](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-20-04), [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), [WAMP](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/), or [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/), but since I run a Windows PC, I tend to prefer the simplicity of [Laragon](https://laragon.org/).

After your AMP stack is up and running, clone this repo to wherever your AMP stack will find it.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:SturmB/php-train.git
```

From there, follow your AMP stack's instructions to open this project in your web browser (or just its `index.php` file).

## To Do

If I have some more time and discipline in the future, I'll revisit this project and add more to it. It does already have the beginnings of more detailed work, but they are not yet implemented.

* Read and set individual train car weights
* Create specific types of train cars and make sure they can be added in their proper place in the train
